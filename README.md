TikTok Share bot | Developed by a.c.o.d.e on tiktok | www.acode.uk
How to run TikTok share bot:

1. Click the green start button
2. Wait for the repl to wake up
3. enter the tiktok url you want to share bot (it should look similar to https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLgyP1Cb) IF YOU ARE ON MOBILE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PASTE THE LINK I RECOMMEND USING PC OR PASTING THE TIKTOK URL INTO AN ALTERNATE APP LIKE 'NOTES' ETC AND MANUALLY TYPE IT OUT.
4. Enter the amount of shares
5. Enter amount of threads to display (pretty much the confirmation of each share sent to the url just put in the same number u put for the shares)
6. Make sure the repl does not sleep
7. watch your tiktok shares rise
